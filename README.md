## Prerequisites
> Install Flask:

```shell
$ pip install Flask
```

> Install Postman (optional):
- Click [here](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) to download

## Installing

### Setup
For Linux and Mac:
> Run in your top-level project directory

```shell
$ export FLASK_APP=flaskr
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run
```
- This will tell Flask where to find your application, then run it in development mode. Development mode shows an interactive debugger whenever a page raises an exception, and restarts the server whenever you make changes to the code. You can leave it running and just reload the browser page.

> Youâ€™ll see output similar to this:
```
* Serving Flask app "flaskr"
* Environment: development
* Debug mode: on
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
* Restarting with stat
* Debugger is active!
* Debugger PIN: 855-212-761
```
- Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in a browser or on Postman
